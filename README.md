# AR book-reading enchancer
## Description
This is my diploma thesis project. It concerns the development of an augmented reality system to enhance the book-reading process. It achieves this by using digital optical and auditory elements that either appear on the device's lens or play from the speakers. The digital elements as well as the book itself can be set at runtime through input files, thus increasing the flexibility of the system.
